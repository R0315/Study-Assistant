# Study-Assistant
An under construction project.

This chat bot is built using Semantic Kernel and Avalonia UI. I intend to add kernel plugins for skills the bot can call to assist with studying or perform other tasks. The main goal of the project is to start learning how to build apps with Avalonia UI just for fun.
If you want to use this project as a base for your own bot or Avalonia UI project, you'll need to set an environment variable for OPENAI_KEY to be used by Semantic Kernel in the [ServiceCollectionExtensions](ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs) class.
